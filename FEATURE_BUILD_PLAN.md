# Feature Build Plan: Farm Commerce Service Gaps

This plan covers the missing capabilities identified in repository review and proposes an implementation sequence across backend (`Medusa` modules/APIs), vendor/admin panels, storefront, and operations tooling.

## Goals

1. Close commerce-operational gaps (POS, weight pricing, pick/pack, invoicing, sync).
2. Add service-layer capabilities (merchant support, managed onboarding, training/resources).
3. Add trust and risk controls (fraud monitoring).
4. Turn ad-hoc marketing/support content into productized programs.

## Delivery Principles

- **Module-first backend design**: each major domain gets a dedicated module with workflows, events, and APIs.
- **Operational visibility**: every feature ships with dashboard views, audit logs, and metrics.
- **Phased rollout**: start with MVP + feature flags, then automate.
- **Multi-channel by default**: storefront, mobile web/PWA, social integrations, and POS sync on a shared product/order/inventory event model.

## Priority Override: Vendor Activation Fast-Track (TTFLL)

If the immediate business priority is **"get vendors signed up and get at least 1 product/service live as fast as possible,"** then the north-star metric for execution is:

- **Time to First Live Listing (TTFLL)**

This track should run before or in parallel with larger platform modules.

### Repository check snapshot (current)

- Managed onboarding appears in Phase 3, but there is no explicit **TTFLL-first 4-step launch wizard** spec in this plan.
- Existing docs reference vendor onboarding and payouts, but there is no explicit requirement here to **defer payout setup until first sale**.
- No explicit **48-hour activation follow-up automation** requirements are captured in this plan.
- No explicit **one-click import (CSV as v1)** requirement is captured in this plan.

### Activation Sprint A (1–2 weeks): launch-first onboarding

**Status: ACTIVE (immediate execution)**

#### Sprint A implementation board

- [ ] A1. Reduce signup to required fields only (`email`, `password/magic-link`, `store_name`).
- [ ] A2. Auto-redirect new vendors into `First Listing` wizard after signup completion.
- [ ] A3. Implement Step 1 selling-type selector (`physical`, `digital`, `service`, `event/class`).
- [ ] A4. Implement Step 2 minimal product form (title, price, description, one image).
- [ ] A5. Implement Step 3 delivery setup by selling type (simple defaults only).
- [ ] A6. Implement Step 4 publish screen with celebration, storefront URL, copy-link, share CTAs.
- [ ] A7. Add `Advanced` accordion for optional fields (SKU, variants, SEO, advanced inventory).
- [ ] A8. Add persistent reassurance copy: "You can edit this anytime."
- [ ] A9. Add wizard autosave + resume support.
- [ ] A10. Add step analytics events and funnel dashboard for drop-off tracking.

#### Sprint A release gates (ship blockers)

- [ ] G1. Median TTFLL <= 5 minutes in staging test cohort.
- [ ] G2. >= 40% test cohort conversion from signup to first live listing in-session.
- [ ] G3. Step-level telemetry visible in analytics for all four wizard steps.

1. **60-second signup (minimal fields only)**
   - Required: email, password/magic link, store name.
   - Defer tax/compliance/payout profile completion to post-listing milestones.

2. **Auto-redirect into a 4-step listing wizard**
   - Step 1: selling type selector (physical, digital, service, event/class).
   - Step 2: minimal product creation (title, price, description, one image).
   - Step 3: delivery setup simplified by listing type.
   - Step 4: publish + celebration state with storefront link and share actions.

3. **Friction controls (required for MVP)**
   - Hide advanced product fields (SKU, variants, SEO, complex inventory) under an expandable "Advanced" section.
   - Persistent reassurance copy: "You can edit this anytime."
   - Progress saved automatically between wizard steps.

4. **Immediate value reveal**
   - Post-publish screen includes copy-link CTA, share buttons, and simple earnings potential explainer.

**Activation Sprint A exit criteria**
- Median TTFLL <= 5 minutes for first-time vendors.
- >= 40% of new signups publish at least one listing within first session.
- Step-level funnel instrumentation available for all 4 wizard steps.

### Activation Sprint B (2–4 weeks): scale listing velocity

5. **One-click import path (v1 CSV)**
   - Add "Already selling elsewhere? Import your products" entry point.
   - CSV mapping flow with downloadable template and error report.
   - Backlog connectors: Shopify/Etsy/TikTok Shop exports.

6. **Pre-filled listing templates**
   - Farm produce, handmade goods, digital download, coaching service templates.
   - Template selector sits before Step 2 and auto-fills relevant fields.

7. **Launch Assist Mode**
   - Optional intake flow (website link, photos, description) to support concierge or semi-automated listing drafting.

8. **Auto-good storefront baseline**
   - Default banner, non-empty layout blocks, and starter theme applied automatically at first publish.

9. **Payout barrier removal**
   - Listing/publishing allowed without payout onboarding.
   - Enforce payout setup only when vendor reaches first sale/first payout threshold.

**Activation Sprint B exit criteria**
- >= 25% reduction in signup drop-off before first publish.
- >= 30% of new vendors publish 3+ listings in first 14 days.

### Activation Sprint C (2 weeks): retention automation and incentives

10. **48-hour follow-up automation**
   - Branch A: signed up but no listing -> help/tutorial/support CTA.
   - Branch B: one listing live -> nudge to add two more listings.

11. **Dashboard micro-coaching**
   - "Your next step to make money" cards tied to activation state.

12. **Early-vendor incentives framework**
   - Badge, reduced fee window, newsletter highlight, social spotlight toggles.

13. **Movement-first onboarding narrative**
   - Onboarding copy explicitly combines earnings value + community-powered commerce mission.

**Activation Sprint C exit criteria**
- Re-engagement rate improves for vendors inactive after signup.
- Email-to-action conversion measurable for both 48-hour branches.

### TTFLL measurement pack (must ship with Sprint A)

- Signup -> first listing publish conversion.
- Average and median TTFLL.
- Drop-off at each wizard step.
- % vendors publishing more than 3 listings.
