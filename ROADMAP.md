# Roadmap

This roadmap provides directional planning for the MercurJS marketplace platform.

## Near-term (0–3 months)

- Vendor activation acceleration (Time to First Live Listing improvements).
- Validation automation rollout (`scripts/release_validation.sh`) on release branches.
- QA remediation and route-contract consistency for admin/vendor/storefront surfaces.
- Open-source readiness package (contribution templates, governance, funding metadata).

## Mid-term (3–9 months)

- Core commerce operations from `FEATURE_BUILD_PLAN.md`:
  - POS session and transaction support.
  - Weight-based pricing rules.
  - Pick/pack batching and operational dashboards.
  - Invoicing and sync hardening.
- Integration reliability improvements (retry policies, idempotent workflows).
- Expanded E2E coverage for cross-module user journeys.

## Long-term (9+ months)

- Multi-channel marketplace sync maturity across storefront/POS/social channels.
- Deeper service layers (merchant support, training program delivery, managed onboarding).
- Risk and trust systems expansion (fraud analytics, policy automation).
- Governance and community economy feature depth.

## Success Signals

- Faster vendor activation and higher first-session publish rate.
- Stable CI with repeatable release validation gates.
- Low critical regression counts across release cycles.
- Healthy contributor pipeline and issue/PR throughput.
