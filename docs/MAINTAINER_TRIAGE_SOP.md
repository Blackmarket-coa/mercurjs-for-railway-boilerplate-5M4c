# Maintainer Triage SOP

## Label Taxonomy

Use these baseline labels:

- `bug`
- `enhancement`
- `documentation`
- `good first issue`
- `help wanted`
- `priority:high`
- `priority:medium`
- `priority:low`

## Triage Workflow

1. Confirm issue template completeness and request missing details.
2. Reproduce or validate scope where possible.
3. Apply area labels (`backend`, `storefront`, `admin-panel`, `vendor-panel`, `infra`, `docs`) as needed.
4. Apply priority label.
5. Mark suitable newcomer issues as `good first issue` + `help wanted`.
6. Link related roadmap/plan item when available.

## First-Time Contributor Handling

- Provide a welcoming first response.
- Point to setup and validation commands in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Offer clarifying implementation boundaries.
- Prefer issues with clear acceptance criteria and small blast radius.
